### Communication Protocol
```
LoRa Target Sensor â†’ ESP32 Bridge â†’ BLE Advertisement â†’ Android ATAK Plugin

BLE GATT Service Structure:
- Service UUID: Custom service for hit indicator data
- Position Characteristic: Target ID, GPS coordinates, timestamp
- Hit Characteristic: Target ID, hit timestamp, impact data
- Battery Characteristic: Target ID, voltage level
- Calibration Characteristic: Bidirectional calibration data

Message Examples:
- Position: "T001,34.1234,-118.5678,100.5,1625097600,12.3"
- Hit: "T001,1625097655,IMPACT"
- Battery: "T001,3.7V"
```

### Database Schema
- Targets stored in-memory with optional persistence
- SQLite integration available for extended storage
- Parcelable implementation for Android lifecycle management

### Testing

### Known Limitations
- **BLE range**: Limited by ESP32 BLE implementation (typically 10-100m)
- **LoRa latency**: Small delay between target hit and BLE advertisement
- **Battery impact**: Continuous BLE scanning affects device battery
- **Data throughput**: BLE has lower throughput than Bluetooth Classic

- **UI problems**: Verify ATAK version compatibility
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage with large target counts
- **Battery drain**: Implement intelligent scanning intervals
- **LoRa issues**: Check antenna connections and frequency settings
